                <p>The RetroDoge project started in May of 2022 after a brainstorming session at FeistyDao, led by CryptoPathic. </p>
                <p>The idea was to create a NFT collection that would bring together the community, by merging art and utility in a creative way. At the center of the discussion was the famous Kabosu NFT, called Feisty Doge. </p>
                <p>A resident artist of FeistyDAO, Lilâ€™ Dojo came up with the idea of representing Feisty Doge in his own vision, with three primary tenets in mind: </p>
                <p>I. Cuteness | II. Time Distortion | III. Utility </p>
